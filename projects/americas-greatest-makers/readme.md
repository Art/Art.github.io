_Things to peruse and think about in regards to filing an application to participate._


## America's Greatest Makers Web Presence

[Application requirements]( https://venertainment.com/America-s-Greatest-Makers/ )

### Pages from the Application Form that need filling out

* https://venertainment.com/America-s-Greatest-Makers/apply-now.php
* https://venertainment.com/America-s-Greatest-Makers/apply-now-step2.php
* https://venertainment.com/America-s-Greatest-Makers/apply-now-step3.php
* https://venertainment.com/America-s-Greatest-Makers/apply-now-step4.php

You need to fill in all the fields in order to get to the next page. Filling in 'none' or 'TBD' seems to work

But the above links may be able to get you to the different pages, without entering any data.



## Instant Analysis

_First reactions at reading the application form._

Fun fact: the web site is almost entirely composed of videos, but I've not looked at any. I don't watch videos because they take too long. ;-)


### > Do you have an amazing idea for the next big smart connected device?


#### Must include a 'device'.

It cannot only be something running on a screen, digital frame, monitor or kiosk.

There must be at least some compoenent that is manufactured and can be sold.

#### Device must be 'connected'

It must be able to communicate or at leasr send feedback via wifi or the Internet.

#### Must be 'smart'

There must be some software or an app that can interpret and share results.

### > Each team entering the call for casting of America’s Greatest Makers Season 2 is required to integrate at least one of the following innovative Intel® technology options 

1. An Intel® Curie™ Compute Module powered board for contestants with smaller form-factor, smart, connected or wearable product ideas.
2. A next-generation Intel® Atom™ processor-based platform providing advanced display, graphics and high-speed I/O in a low-power, small form-factor configuration for product ideas.
3. The Intel® RealSense™ ZR300 camera offers a small form-factor solution for contestants who want to add visual depth sensing and tracking capabilities to their product ideas.

The first requires a lot of hardware experience. Sourcing such experience in the given time frame seems unlikely.

The second is a given. It's a computer. One that heppens to be made by Intel, but still just a computer.

The third is the interesting item: a 3D sensing camera.


## Project Concepts

_Concepts for projects we could submit._

The idea is to help peeps have a better understanding of various STEM topics by working on projects that not only do fun things,
but you can also double-click and find out more.

1. We show you how to make something - with customs plans you can print
2. You make it - assisted by our AR tools
3. We tell you the physics about what you have made and help you share it - using our AR tools




### ARrery = AR + Orrery

_An orrery made by Robert Brettell Bate, circa 1812. Source Wikipedia_

We provide all the knowledge for you to build an orrery.

This could include:

* Plans and schematics 
* Tool paths for CNC work
* STL files for 3D printing
* Use camera to verify integrity of components parts

We provide all the assembly instructions:

* PDF like Ikea
* 3D 'moving manuals'
* Use camera to verify all stages of the assembly process


Once constructed and running, you can aim the camera at the ARery and view data and augmented reality including

* The classical names and descriptions for each component
* Each components physical properties such as size, distance from Sun, length of year
* The deeper physics aspects such as visualizations of the Runge vector or the Kepler two body problems
* Paths of virtual comets and satellites may be observed


### Wooden ClARck = AR + wooden clock

![]( https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/warehouse/getpubliccontent?contentId=88db2228-9ac1-4356-9303-d16f8abd6c95 )

_Clock project from 3D Warehouse_


Like the orrery, we supply all plans, scripts, specs whatever to help you build a working woodem clock.

Throught the process the RealSense camera is use to verify the integrity of the components and the process.

Pointing the RealSense camera at the clARck can provides you with feedback including:

* The classical terms for each component lever escapement etc
* The RPM and geear ratios for each gear
* The friction and enregy drain for each gear
* Fun facts about the current time
* At the appointed time, if the camera is viewing the clock, a vurtual cuckoo appears and the sound of Big Ben can be heard


### ARnalemma = AR + analemma

![]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Kew_Gardens_0502.JPG/320px-Kew_Gardens_0502.JPG )

Like the orrery, we supply all plans, scripts, specs whatever to help you build a working sun dial customised for any latitude and lontitude.

Pointing the RealSense camera at the clARck provides you with feedback including:

* Display of virtual analemmas
* And much more


### Further thoughts

In any of the above scenarios, what nice thing could happen if a number of people are using their RealSence cameras and 
focussing on the project:

* In the same room?
* Across the world?

Can we build something special?

Can we use Lego pieces to build our project. Or any components that could attrect sponorship

Could we create a photovoltaic solar energy project?

* Uses geolocation to help you tilt your panel nicely
* AR creates a demo of photons coming in and being put to work or reflected or wasted

Can we build a [theramin]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin ) using the RealSense camera?

Could we build a musical instrument using the controller?
