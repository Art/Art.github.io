## Welcome Message 

Here is a welcome message you can copy and paste into the 'Write a welcome message' text area:


Welcome to the  art-github-io@googlegroups.com  mailing list.

This email list is for friends of the http://art.github.io web site.

The mission of the project is to help youngsters and oldsters investigate aspects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics all with an emphasis on art.


## Notes

The mailing list script is failrly smart. If it sees duplicates recipients - ie a person's address appears in the To lis and is also a member of the group - only a single message is sent.
