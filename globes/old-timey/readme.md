## Introduction to R1


* The editor wants to know: who, what, when, where and why
* Similarly, the business analyst wants to know
	* People
	* Products
	* Strategies
	* Markets
	* Financials
* So let's double click into the possibilities and what we know so far for art.github.io using these topic headings

### See also [Demos]( #demos.md )

## 1. People / Who

* Mostly ordinary peeps 
* Grad degree level
* Successful careers
* **Secret sauce**: tinkerers, lifelong learners

### Art

* Marketing from the moment he wakes up in the morning

### Cindy

* Thinking operations and QA incessently

### Theo

* Coding late morning, noon and late night

## 2. Products / What

### Overview

* Coding for 3D
* Real-time animations
* Taking ideas that used to be mainframe only and making them work in your browser
* Coding for STEM peeps to read easily instead of coding to impress programmers

Programmers look at the code and say: WTF, too much linear algebra

Engineers and designers look at the code and say: finally code I can understand


### 3D Capabilities

* STEM oriented
* Astronomy
* Solar energy
* Cartography
* Parametric components
* Assembly processes
* Data visualization
* 3D model visualization


### Operations Management

All art.githib.io designs and code are created, edited and hosted in the cloud on [GitHub]( http://github/com ).

GitHub is the largest code host on the planet with over 31 million repositories. 
Large or small, every repository comes with the same powerful tools. 
These tools are open to the community for public projects and secure for private projects.
There are many features and benefits to the use of GitHub as a digital repository for 3D designs.
These are features simply not available via the traditional design firm and normal designer/client collaboration.

The following topics cover the advantages of being on GitHub - and enabling small teams and big teams to collaborate without skipping a beat.

* Git revision control and tracking for every aspect of the operation
* Collaborative design reviews
* Issue management and feedback / Integrated issue tracking
* Serious security
* Access to Content Delivery Networks( CDN )




## 3. Strategies / When

### No 'walled gardens'

* Web app oriented from get-go
	* Work anywhere a browser works
	* Mobile friendly
	* But downstream updates can transform
		* Android/iOS apps
		* Python code for rPIs

### Stand on the shoulders of giants

* We make high end ideas workable on entry level systems
* We build challenging/disruptive scenarios

### Everything verifiable

* All algorithms have links to original source
* All calculations explained in detail
* Bidirectional links between our apps and Wikipedia   

### Create bidirectional movement between simulation and reality

* Simulation to reality: Transform ideas/demos/simulations into physical products
* Reality to simulation: Overlay physical products with augmented reality showing the physics

### Establish bidirectional-friendly creation process

* Design and code a simulation based on our cookbook code examples
* Using our parametric component technology, we help you design a series of products
* Using our assembly scripts you can verify the assembly process
* Once built and running, our augmented reality scripts help you visualize the physics behind what you are seeing 


Typical scenario

* Create a 3D simulation of some aspect of the solar system
* Design and build an [orrery]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrery ) that demonstrates the aspect
* Use Google Cardboard, Microsoft Halo, Magic Leap or other augmented reality device to view the orrery with graphice overlaid that show the physics that's occurring 



## 4. Markets / Where

Follow [Pareto principle]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle )

We look for

* Content creators more than content consumers
	* 'Pareto peeps'
	* the 20% of oldsters who still have something to give
	* The 20% of youngsters who still have something to gain




## 5. Financials / Vision / Life force / Why

* All FOSS
* Role models include
	* Linux organization
	* JavaScript language association
	* Python organization
	* Arduino
	* Raspberry Pi
